Your program is to use the brute-force approach in order to find the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. 
  More preciselyâ€¦ rewrite small numbers from input to output.
  Stop processing input after reading in the number 42.
  All numbers at input are integers of one or two digits.

Sample Input:
1
2
88
42
99
Sample Output:
1
2
88



////    CODE  /////





#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	
	int x;
	while(true){
	    cin>>x;
	    if(x==42){
	        break;
	    }else{
	        cout<<x<<endl;
	    }
	    
	}
	return 0;
}
